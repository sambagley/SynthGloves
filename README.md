# SynthGloves
This project started as an Embedded Systems course project. We wanted to create something musical and were inspired by the Gloves created by Imogen Heap. 

Where this project mainly differs from just being an amateur clone of those gloves is that rather than being a controller that you can set up to control arbitrary things in a DAW, we wanted to make it into its own complete instrument, that has its own sound synthesis and built in looping and sampling features.
